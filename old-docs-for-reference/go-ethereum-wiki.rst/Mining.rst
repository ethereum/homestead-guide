CPU Mining with Geth
====================

At Frontier, the first release of Ethereum, you'll just need a) a GPU
and b) an Ethereum client, Geth. CPU mining will be possible but too
inefficient to hold any value.

At the moment, Geth only includes a CPU miner, and the team is testing a
`GPU miner
branch <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/gpu_miner>`__, but
this won't be part of Frontier.

The C++ implementation of Ethereum also offers a GPU miner, both as part
of Eth (its CLI), AlethZero (its GUI) and EthMiner (the standalone
miner).

***NOTE:** Ensure your blockchain is fully synchronized with the main
chain before starting to mine, otherwise you will not be mining on the
main chain.*

When you start up your Ethereum node with ``geth`` it is not mining by
default. To start it in mining mode, you use the ``--mine`` `command
line
option <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options>`__.
The ``-minerthreads`` parameter can be used to set the number parallel
mining threads (defaulting to the total number of processor cores).

``geth --mine --minerthreads=4``

You can also start and stop CPU mining at runtime using the
`console <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console#adminminerstart>`__.
``miner.start`` takes an optional parameter for the number of miner
threads.

::

    > miner.start(8)
    true
    > miner.stop()
    true

Note that mining for real ether only makes sense if you are in sync with
the network (since you mine on top of the consensus block). Therefore
the eth blockchain downloader/synchroniser will delay mining until
syncing is complete, and after that mining automatically starts unless
you cancel your intention with ``miner.stop()``.

In order to earn ether you must have your **etherbase** (or
**coinbase**) address set. This etherbase defaults to your `primary
account <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Managing-your-accounts>`__.
If you don't have an etherbase address, then ``geth --mine`` will not
start up.

You can set your etherbase on the command line:

::

    geth --etherbase 1 --mine  2>> geth.log // 1 is index: second account by creation order OR
    geth --etherbase '0xa4d8e9cae4d04b093aac82e6cd355b6b963fb7ff' --mine 2>> geth.log

You can reset your etherbase on the console too:

::

    miner.setEtherbase(eth.accounts[2])

Note that your etherbase does not need to be an address of a local
account, just an existing one.

There is an option `to add extra
Data <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console#adminminersetextra>`__
(32 bytes only) to your mined blocks. By convention this is interpreted
as a unicode string, so you can set your short vanity tag.

::

    miner.setExtra("ΞTHΞЯSPHΞЯΞ")
    ...
    debug.printBlock(131805)
    BLOCK(be465b020fdbedc4063756f0912b5a89bbb4735bd1d1df84363e05ade0195cb1): Size: 531.00 B TD: 643485290485 {
    NoNonce: ee48752c3a0bfe3d85339451a5f3f411c21c8170353e450985e1faab0a9ac4cc
    Header:
    [
    ...
            Coinbase:           a4d8e9cae4d04b093aac82e6cd355b6b963fb7ff
            Number:             131805
            Extra:              ΞTHΞЯSPHΞЯΞ
    ...
    }

proposal <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Extra-Data>`__

You can check your hashrate with
`miner.hashrate <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console#adminminerhashrate>`__,
the result is in H/s (Hash operations per second).

::

    > miner.hashrate
    712000

After you successfully mined some blocks, you can check the ether
balance of your etherbase account. Now assuming your etherbase is a
local account:

::

    > eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase).toNumber();
    '34698870000000'

In order to spend your earnings `on gas to
transact <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contracts-and-Transactions>`__,
you will need to have this account unlocked.

::

    > personal.unlockAccount(eth.coinbase)
    Password
    true

You can check which blocks are mined by a particular miner (address)
with the following code snippet on the console:

::

    function minedBlocks(lastn, addr) {
      addrs = [];
      if (!addr) {
        addr = eth.coinbase
      }
      limit = eth.blockNumber - lastn
      for (i = eth.blockNumber; i >= limit; i--) {
        if (eth.getBlock(i).miner == addr) {
          addrs.push(i)
        }
      }
      return addrs
    }
    // scans the last 1000 blocks and returns the blocknumbers of blocks mined by your coinbase
    // (more precisely blocks the mining reward for which is sent to your coinbase).
    minedBlocks(1000, eth.coinbase);
    //[352708, 352655, 352559]

Note that it will happen often that you find a block yet it never makes
it to the canonical chain. This means when you locally include your
mined block, the current state will show the mining reward credited to
your account, however, after a while, the better chain is discovered and
we switch to a chain in which your block is not included and therefore
no mining reward is credited. Therefore it is quite possible that as a
miner monitoring their coinbase balance will find that it may fluctuate
quite a bit.

The logs show locally mined blocks confirmed after 5 blocks. At the
moment you may find it easier and faster to generate the list of your
mined blocks from these logs.

Mining success depends on the set block difficulty. Block difficulty
dynamically adjusts each block in order to regulate the network hashing
power to produce a 12 second blocktime. Your chances of finding a block
therefore follows from your hashrate relative to difficulty. The time
you need to wait you are expected to find a block can be estimated with
the following code:

**INCORRECT...CHECKING**

::

    etm = eth.getBlock("latest").difficulty/miner.hashrate; // estimated time in seconds
    Math.floor(etm / 3600.) + "h " + Math.floor((etm % 3600)/60) + "m " +  Math.floor(etm % 60) + "s";
    // 1h 3m 30s

Given a difficulty of 3 billion, a typical CPU with 800KH/s is expected
to find a block every ....?

GPU mining
==========

--------------

Hardware
--------

The algorithm is memory hard and in order to fit the DAG into memory, it
needs 1-2GB of RAM on each GPU. If you get
``Error GPU mining. GPU memory fragmentation?`` you havent got enough
memory.

The GPU miner is implemented in OpenCL, so AMD GPUs will be 'faster'
than same-category NVIDIA GPUs.

ASICs and FPGAs are relatively inefficient and therefore discouraged.

To get openCL for your chipset and platform, try: \* `AMD SDK
openCL <http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk>`__
\* `NVIDIA CUDA openCL <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__

Mining Software
---------------

The official Frontier release of ``geth`` only supports a CPU miner
natively. We are working on a `GPU
miner <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/gpuminer>`__, but it
may not be available for the Frontier release. Geth however can be used
in conjunction with ``ethminer``, using the standalone miner as workers
and ``geth`` as scheduler communicating via
`JSON-RPC <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC>`__.

The `C++ implementation of
Ethereum <https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/>`__ (not officially
released) however has a GPU miner. It can be used from ``eth``,
``AlethZero`` (GUI) and ``ethMiner`` (the standalone miner).

`You can install
this <https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Installing-clients>`__
via ppa on linux, brew tap on MacOS or from source.

On MacOS:

::

    brew install cpp-ethereum --with-gpu-mining --devel --build-from-source

On Linux:

::

    apt-get install cpp-ethereum

On Windows:
https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Building-on-Windows

GPU mining with ethminer
------------------------

To mine with ``eth``:

::

    eth -m on -G -a <coinbase> -i -v 8 //

To install ``ethminer`` from source:

::

    cd cpp-ethereum
    cmake -DETHASHCL=1 -DGUI=0
    make -j4
    make install

To set up GPU mining you need a coinbase account. It can be an account
created locally or remotely.

Using ethminer with geth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    geth account new
    geth --rpc --rpccorsdomain localhost 2>> geth.log &
    ethminer -G  // -G for GPU, -M for benchmark
    tail -f geth.log

``ethminer`` communicates with geth on port 8545 (the default RPC port
in geth). You can change this by giving the ```--rpcport``
option <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/Command-Line-Options>`__
to ``geth``. Ethminer will find get on any port. Note that you need to
set the CORS header with ``--rpccorsdomain localhost``. You can also set
port on ``ethminer`` with ``-F http://127.0.0.1:3301``. Setting the
ports is necessary if you want several instances mining on the same
computer, although this is somewhat pointless. If you are testing on a
private cluster, we recommend you use CPU mining instead.

Also note that you do **not** need to give ``geth`` the ``--mine``
option or start the miner in the console unless you want to do CPU
mining on TOP of GPU mining.

If the default for ``ethminer`` does not work try to specify the OpenCL
device with: ``--opencl-device X`` where X is 0, 1, 2, etc. When running
``ethminer`` with ``-M`` (benchmark), you should see something like:

::

    Benchmarking on platform: { "platform": "NVIDIA CUDA", "device": "GeForce GTX 750 Ti", "version": "OpenCL 1.1 CUDA" }


    Benchmarking on platform: { "platform": "Apple", "device": "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 v2 @ 3.70GHz", "version": "OpenCL 1.2 " }

To debug ``geth``:

::

    geth  --rpccorsdomain "localhost" --verbosity 6 2>> geth.log

To debug the miner:

::

    make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DETHASHCL=1 -DGUI=0
    gdb --args ethminer -G -M

**Note** hashrate info is not available in ``geth`` when GPU mining.
Check your hashrate with ``ethminer``, ``miner.hashrate`` will always
report 0.

ethminer and eth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ethminer`` can be used in conjunction with ``eth`` via rpc

::

    eth -i -v 8 -j // -j for rpc
    ethminer -G -M // -G for GPU, -M for benchmark
    tail -f geth.log

or you can use ``eth`` to GPU mine by itself:

::

    eth -m on -G -a <coinbase> -i -v 8 //
