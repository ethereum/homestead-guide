Sprint plan
===========

scope
=====

-  forwarding only (no recursive lookup and no connecting to new nodes,
   only working with active peers)

TODO
----

-  integrate new p2p
-  write unit tests for protocol and netstore (without protocol)
-  rework protocol errors using errs after PR merged
-  integrate new p2p or develop branch after p2p merge
-  integrate cademlia into hive / peer pool with new p2p
-  work out timeouts and timeout encoding
-  cli tools
-  url bar and proxy

CLI
---

-  hooking into DPA local API
-  running as a daemon accepting request via socket?

Encryption
----------

-  encryption gateway to incentivize encryption of public content
-  xor encryption with random chunks
-  in-memory encryption keys
-  originator encryption for private content

APIs
----

-  Dapp API - js integration (Fabian, Alex)
-  Mist dapp storage scheme, url->hash mapping (Fabian, Alex)
   https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/URL-Scheme

Discuss alternatives
====================

I suggest we each pick 2/3 and read up on their project status,
features, usability, objectives, etc - Is it even worth it to
reinvent/reimplement the wheel? - what features do we want now and in
future - roadmap

Brainstorming
=============

-  storage economy, incentivisation, examples: -- content owner pays
   recurring ether fee for storage. -- scheme to reward content owner
   each time content is accessed. i.e accessing content would requires
   fee. this would reward popular content. should be optional though.
-  dht - chain interaction
-  proof of custody
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F81ulKEZFPIGNEVRsx0H1gl2YRtf0mUMsX011BzSjnY/edit
-  proof of resources
   http://systemdocs.maidsafe.net/content/system\_components/proof\_of\_resources.html
-  nonoutsourceable proofs of storage as mining criteria
-  proof of storage capacity directly rewarded by contract
-  streaming, hash chains
-  routing and learning graph traversal
-  minimizing hops
-  forwarding strategies, optimizing dispersion of requests
-  lifetime of requests, renewals (repeated retrieval requests), expiry,
   reposting (repeated storage request)
-  redundancy - store same data in multiple nodes (e.g 4x)
-  the more accessed a content is, the more available it should be,
   should increase performance for popular content.

Simulations
===========

-  full table homogeneous nodes network size vs density vs table size
   expected row-sizes
-  forwarding strategy vs latency vs traffic
-  stable table, dropout rate vs routing optimization by precalculating
   subtables for all peers. expected distance change (proximity delta)
   per hop

Swarm

How far does the analogy go?

+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| swarm of bees            | a decentralized network of peers                 |
+==========================+==================================================+
| living in a hive         | form a distributed preimage archive              |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| where they               | where they                                       |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| gather pollen            | gather data chunks which they                    |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| to produce honey         | transform into a longer data stream (document)   |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| they consume and store   | they serve and store                             |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| buzzing bzz              | using bzz as their communications protocol       |
