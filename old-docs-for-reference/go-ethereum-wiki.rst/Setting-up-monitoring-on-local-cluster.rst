This page describes how to set up a monitoring site, `like this
one <http://eth-netstats.herokuapp.com/>`__, for your private network.
It builds upon `this wiki
article <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster>`__
and assumes you've created a local cluster using `this script
(gethcluster.sh) <https://github.com/ethersphere/eth-utils>`__.

The monitoring system consists of two components:

1. **eth-netstats** - the monitoring site which lists the nodes.
2. **eth-net-intelligence-api** - these are processes that communicate
   with the Ethereum client using RPC and push the data to the
   monitoring site via websockets.

Monitoring site
===============

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

::

    git clone https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats
    cd eth-netstats
    npm install

Then choose a secret and start the app:

::

    WS_SECRET=<chosen_secret> npm start

You can now access the (empty) monitoring site at
``http://localhost:3000``.

You can also choose a different port:

::

    PORT=<chosen_port> WS_SECRET=<chosen_secret> npm start

Client-side information relays
==============================

These processes will relay the information from each of your cluster
nodes to the monitoring site using websockets.

Clone the repo, install dependencies and make sure you have pm2
installed:

::

    git clone https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api
    cd eth-net-intelligence-api
    npm install
    sudo npm install -g pm2

Now, use `this script
(netstatconf.sh) <https://github.com/ethersphere/eth-utils>`__ to create
an ``app.json`` suitable for pm2.

Usage:

::

    bash netstatconf.sh <number_of_clusters> <name_prefix> <ws_server> <ws_secret>

-  ``number_of_clusters`` is the number of nodes in the cluster.
-  ``name_prefix`` is a prefix for the node names as will appear in the
   listing.
-  ``ws_server`` is the eth-netstats server. Make sure you write the
   full URL, for example: http://localhost:3000.
-  ``ws_secret`` is the eth-netstats secret.

For example:

::

    bash netstatconf.sh 5 mynode http://localhost:3000 big-secret > app.json

Run the script and copy the resulting ``app.json`` into the
``eth-net-intelligence-api`` directory. Afterwards, ``cd`` into
``eth-net-intelligence-api`` and run the relays using
``pm2 start app.json``. To stop the relays, you can use
``pm2 delete app.json``.

**NOTE**: The script assumes the nodes have RPC ports 8101, 8102, ... .
If that's not the case, edit app.json and change it accordingly for each
peer.

At this point, open ``http://localhost:3000`` and your monitoring site
should monitor all your nodes!
