This page describes some ideas that I (Vitalik) have that I would like
to see implemented, but do not have time for myself. If anyone wants
advice on how to implement them feel free to ping me at any time, or
just start yourself.

Data Feed
~~~~~~~~~

The core idea behind a data feed is simple: a data feed is a contract
with an administrator that maintains a key-value store, where the keys
represent what data is stored (eg. "BTC/USD") and the values represent
the value that the administrator believes the variable currently is in
the real world (eg. 235). A simple data feed contract can be found `in
the standardized contract APIs
repository <https://github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/tree/master/standardized_contract_apis/fee_charging_datafeed.sol>`__;
it has a ``set`` function which allows its administrator to set the
value for a particular key, and a ``get`` function which allows anyone
to get the value for a particular key; that particular contract also
allows the administrator to set a fee in ether.

Regarding fee setting, note that you should not set the fee too high as
otherwise it's possible at medium cost to create a "caching passthrough
contract": essentially, the smart contract equivalent of piracy, and
there's no way to prevent that without compromising the flexibility that
makes Ethereum Ethereum; a fee of around 1-10 finney should be fair and
work well if you do wish to charge.

The way that you would implement the server side code is simple. In
pseudocode, you can implement it as a separate daemon that accesses an
api:

::

    keys = [("BTC/USD", "http://my_exchange.com/api/BTCUSD?password=12345"),
            ("CHF/USD", "http://my_exchange.com/api/CHFUSD?password=12345"),
            ("temperature:Seattle", "http://my_weather_network.com/api/temperature/Seattle?password=12346"),
              ... ]
    for key, url in keys:
        try:
            value = json.loads(open(url))["value"]
            ethereum.send_transaction(ethereum.get_nonce(ethereum.my_address), ethereum.get_gasprice(),
                                     200000, MY_DATAFEED_CONTRACT, 0, MY_DATAFEED_ABI.encode('set', [key, value])
        except:
            pass

(Note: the above is pseudocode; not all of the above methods are
available in pyethereum quite yet).

If you control:

-  An exchange or other website that has access to price feed or index
   data
-  A weather network
-  A site that lists results of real-life events
-  A service that KYCs people and assigns them unique identity tokens
-  Any other data repository

Then the Ethereum ecosystem will benefit from you publishing a data feed
contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

A closely related idea is an **HTTP getter passthrough contract**.
Essentially, the contract would have one method, ``get(string)``, that
would take a URL as an argument, and simply log the URL alongside the
address that asked for the get. A server daemon would make a curl
request to the URL, and call the ``passthroughCallback(string)`` method
of the sender address with the output. Note that multiple daemons
running in this form could be called in multisig fashion if desired.

Web of trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reputation and credit scores are potentially a very powerful economic
lubricant in modern society, allowing us to easily tell reliable from
unreliable parties, and are even more important in a decentralized world
where centralized curation is unavailable and many classes of regulation
become more difficult to enforce. The question of "can this user be
trusted?" is approximated with a simple and easy-to-understand number.

Currently, such systems are actively being looked into and adopted by
private companies particularly in the "sharing economy":

.. raw:: html

   </center>

And even governments:

   </center>

However, if we want to create a globally accessible system, centralized
credit scores are arguably insufficient: not everyone in the world will
be willing to trust a particular entity to provide accurate and fair
credit scores, particularly in international cases where there are large
political differences. Hence, while centralized credit scores may work
in particular closed environments, in an international trade context it
would be more ideal to have a global framework that allows specialized
scoring agencies to exist, but which allows recipients to choose which
ones they "listen" to, and even combine their scores.

A highly effective solution to this problem, which has existed in
academia and the public for over a decade, uses the "web of trust"
route: essentially, instead of trying to achieve a single universal
score for everyone, provide a way for each person to score anyone else
from their own point of view. This is accomplished through the trust
transitivity heuristic: if A trusts B, and B trusts C, then to some
degree that's cause for A to trust C. In some ways, centralized credit
scores are a special case of this: everyone trusts the central agency
(in theory), the central agency assigns people trust ratings, and so
that's how much everyone is induced to trust everyone else. However, the
decentralized approach is more general, and ideally allows us to take
into account *all* "chains of trust" between two people, and not just
the ones that flow through a particular centralized gateway.

   :alt:

One example of an algorithm that does this well is the `Advogato trust
metric <http://www.advogato.org/trust-metric.html>`__, a trust score
scheme based on
`max-flow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem>`__.

A useful project would be to create an implementation of such a system
on Ethereum, and create a dapp by which anyone can register an identity,
and register trust scores for other identities. Then, create a
decentralized cloud computing service by which anyone can query "provide
a proof, consisting of a list of trust paths, showing the Advogato trust
score from A to B" and anyone can reply in exchange for a micropayment
(or perhaps create a server that does it for free, and convince a
charity to subsidize it); if user A wants to know "what is B's trust
score", they can make this query, receive the result, verify the proof,
and then display it.

This system could then be used by many other dapps on Ethereum,
including financial contract using price feeds and arbitration.

Financial Derivatives Market
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Essentially, a polished, working dapp that allows users to make options
on any Ethereum asset, and derivatives (eg. CFDs) on any Ethereum price
feed. This should support "multisig price feeds": choosing multiple data
feed contract addresses that support a particular ticker symbol, and
taking the median of them, so as to remove reliance on any single party.

Supported actions should ideally include:

-  Entering into CFDs with other parties on any price index, settling in
   any standards-compatible currency or asset (though perhaps start with
   ETH)
-  Options between any two assets (though perhaps start with
   asset<->ETH)
-  Plain old regular asset exchange
-  An order book for all of the above

RANDAO
~~~~~~

Essentially,
`this <https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2031/randao-a-dao-working-as-rng>`__.
Set it up as a decentralized service which any lottery or other
randomness-based game can use; also, build a "full node software"
package/plugin which facilitates participating in the RANDAO by
providing random numbers.

Interface with national ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a system, relying on trusting no one other than the original
issuer, by which users with electronic identities (eg. Estonian digital
ID, other electronic passports, crypto KYC schemes, etc) can prove to
the Ethereum blockchain that they have that particular ID. Note that
this can be plugged into the WoT by, eg, creating a contract which
trusts everyone who has an Estonian digital ID with score 1.

Zero knowledge proofs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create multiple compatible implementations of a ZK-SNARK protocol.

Ultrahard KDFs for brainwallets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A decentralized paid cloud computing service for brainwallet
computations, combined with a client-side solution, in order to
implement my proposal for ultra-secure brainwallets using
blind-outsourceable ultrahard KDFs:
https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/23/information-theoretic-account-secure-brainwallets/

Estonia ID integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a system which integrates the Estonian digital ID system into
Ethereum; essentially, create a registry where someone can link their
address to a particular Estonian digital ID by signing a transaction
with their ID. The registry should cryptographically verify that the
signature is valid and that it matches a particular ID, and should then
store a mapping, eg. ``address -> (first name, last name, number)``

Security Deposit-backed Conditional Hashcash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The key piece of technology that later spawned the advent of blockchains
starting with Bitcoin, proof of work, was originally devised for quite a
different application: email spam prevention. In order to send an email
that would be viewed by recipients' email interfaces, users would need
to complete a certain amount of computational work on their computers
that could quickly be verified. This would impose a small cost in
electricity and CPU power to sending an email (say, $0.01) that would in
theory be no problem for ordinary messages, but would be so expensive as
to make spam no longer worth it. In practice, this idea never succeeded,
in large part because people did not want to pay for their email and
because it would only lead to spammers paying more in order to send more
well-crafted emails to fewer parties, which would be more likely to
receive attention because users think that they already passed the proof
of work filter.

Here, I propose a proof of stake twist on the algorithm that would solve
this problem. The key insight is that instead of making the sender
*always* pay the cost, we make the cost a security deposit, and the
recipient has the right, only if they wish, to destroy the security
deposit at no benefit to themselves (in an actual implementation,
"destroy" will hopefully mean something like "donate to protocol
developers"). Ordinary "useful" messages would get through unscathed,
and spam would be punished in proportion to the percentage of people
that find it scammy. The conditional nature of the protocol can
theoretically allow the deposits to be increased much higher than the
cost of proof of work; deposits of $1 or even higher are quite
reasonable.

There are two possible extensions to this idea:

1. Use techniques similar to `anti-pre-revelation
   games <https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/28/on-anti-pre-revelation-games/#comment-2230211912>`__
   (or possibly other techniques) to allow users to destroy other users'
   security deposits (either probabilistically or fully) without the
   victim knowing who did it. This allows the mechanism to be used more
   effectively in intra-organizational and social situations, so that
   you can punish people for being annoying without extra-protocol
   repercussions. Aside from information-theoretic strategies, there may
   be routes to doing this using Chaumian blinding schemes,
   cryptographic accumulators and/or zk-SNARK proofs; the goal to target
   would be in a scenario with one sender and N recipients, with the
   sender having a deposit of $NX, giving each recipient the right to
   destroy $X exactly once without revealing which one of the N they
   are; the main challenge is the sender gleaning this information by
   simulating the process of each single recipient destroying their
   deposit and seeing which one(s) fail, and so private information on
   the recipients' part and perhaps even an interactive protocol is
   required.
2. Have different levels of deposits, where higher levels of deposits
   can be used to signal more importance/urgency in the interface; at
   the highest levels, one could imagine a deposit of $500 leading to
   one's phone ringing maximally loudly whereas a deposit of $0.1 would
   only lead to an email appearing next time one opens one's mailbox.
