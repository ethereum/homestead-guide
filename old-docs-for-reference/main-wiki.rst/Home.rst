Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki
============================

This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information
on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by ÐΞV
including **Ethereum**, *the generalized blockchain for smart contract
development*, and **Whisper**, *the private low-level datagram
communication platform*.

Frontier
~~~~~~~~

Version 1.0 of Ethereum aka Frontier was released on July 30th 2015!
Development continues towards the versions named Homestead, Metropolis
and Serenity (v1.1). Frontier is aimed at exchangers and
`miners <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining>`__. Homestead is
aiming for `Ðapps
developers <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Dapp-Developer-Resources>`__,
while Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist
browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through
`Proof-of-Work <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash>`__ to
`Proof-of-Stake <https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/>`__.
