Welcome to Mix IDE!
===================

This guide provides a very simple and quick introduction to the Mix IDE
workflow by walking you through the creation of a simple dapp. Once you
are done with this tutorial, you will have a general knowledge of how to
create and run applications in the IDE.

Note that the software is in still in proof-of-concept state. Things are
changing rapidly and this tutorial might not be up to date. If that is
the case `please open an
issue <https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues>`__ or `edit the
wiki <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mix%3A-The-DApp-IDE/_edit>`__.

Getting started.
----------------

This tutorial assumes you have `C++ Ethereum
installed <https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki>`__. If this is
the case, then Mix is already installed.

Creating a new project
----------------------

Let's create a simple dapp that will allow user to store and query
personal movie ratings.

In the IDE, choose ``File > New Project``. Enter the project name
"MovieRatings" and a path for the project file. To the left there is a
project items list with two items added by default: Sample and
index.html. Contract contains
`Solidity <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial>`__
contract code, and index.html is for the front-end. You can add new
contract files to the project using file menu. All files will be copied
to the project directory. By default a sample contract is created.

Select Sample and enter the text for the rating contract:

.. code:: js

        contract Rating {
            function setRating(bytes32 _key, uint256 _value) {
                ratings[_key] = _value;
            }
            mapping (bytes32 => uint256) public ratings;
        }

Check `Solidity
tutorial <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial>`__
for solidity reference.

Now select ``index.html`` and enter the following html code:

.. code:: html

        <!doctype>
        <html>
        <head>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        function getRating() {
            var param = document.getElementById("query").value;
            var res = contracts["Rating"].contract.ratings(param);
            document.getElementById("queryres").innerText = res;
        }

        function setRating() {
            var key = document.getElementById("key").value;
            var value = parseInt(document.getElementById("value").value);
            var res = contracts["Rating"].contract.setRating(key, value);
        }
        </script>
        </head>
        <body bgcolor="#E6E6FA">
            <h1>Ratings</h1>
            <div>
                Store:
                <input type="string" id="key">
                <input type="number" id="value">
                <button onclick="setRating()">Save</button>
            </div>
            <div>
                Query:
                <input type="string" id="query" onkeyup='getRating()'>
                <div id="queryres"></div>
            </div>
        </body>
        </html>

Note that Mix exposes the following objects into the global window
context: \*
```web3`` <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3>`__
- Ethereum JavaScript API

-  ``contracts`` - A collection of contract objects. A key to the
   collection is the contract name. A value is an object with the
   following properties:
-  ``contract`` - Contract object instance (created as in
   ``web3.eth.contract``)
-  ``address`` - Contract address from the last deployed state (see
   below)
-  ``interface`` - Contract ABI

Check the `JavaScript API
Reference <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API>`__ for
further information.

Select ``File > Save`` to save project files. You should see the web
preview in the web preview pane.

Setting up scenario
-------------------

Now we need to configure a scenario for debugging. Mix has its own
blockchain that is reset on each debugging session. Scenarios are used
to get the blockchain to a point where it is possible to make
transactions and calls to a contract. A scenario is defined by a
sequence of transactions that create dapp and all dependencies on the
blockchain and set up dapp initial storage.

If the scenario panel on the right side is not open, open it by pressing
``F7`` or selecting ``Windows > Show right view`` from the menu. A
default scenario is already created (which contains the transaction
which deploy the Sample contract). We don't need this anymore. Click on
the green checkbox on the left side of the transaction. This will delete
the transaction on the next rebuild. The rebuild button is blinking it
means that the scenario needs to be rebuilt in order to apply changes.
Click on it.

At this point we have a clean blockchain. Click on the icon "add
Transaction..." which is represented by a flying blue plane. Be sure to
have selected "Create Contract" and that the contract "Rating" is
selected. Apply changes. The contract is now deployed and you can use it
from the web preview. Let's create a new transaction. Click an "add
Transaction..." then select "Transact with Contract". The deployed
contract "Rating - O" should be selected, this is the one which has been
previously deployed. You want now to call the function "setRating".
Select the function and give some parameters (for instance Titanic for
the first parameter and an integer for the second). Apply changes.

Now let's test out contract. Type "Titanic" in the web preview query
input and you should see the result returned. Enter a name and a rating
in store fields and click ``Save`` to add a new rating. Note that all
transactions and calls made to the contract during state deployment and
debugging session are recorded into the scenario panel to the right (you
can hide calls by unselecting the option "Scenario > Display calls" in
the mix menu). Now it is possible to debug a transaction. Expand one
transaction (by clicking on the arrow on the right side) and on "Debug
Transaction".

Debugging
---------

Mix currently supports assembly level contract code debugging. Source
level debugging is a work in progress.

Assembly level debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double-click a ``setRating`` transaction in the transaction log to debug
it. The VM assembly code is loaded into the assembly view and the
execution slider is reset to a first position. You can navigate the
execution using the slider and/or step buttons. At any execution point
the following information is available:

-  VM stack.
-  Call stack - Grows when contract is calling into another contract.
   Double click a stack frame to view the machine state in that frame
-  Storage - Storage data associated with the contract
-  Memory - Machine memory allocated up to this execution point
-  Call data - Transaction or call parameters

See the `Ethereum Yellow Paper <http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf>`__ for VM
instruction description.

Deployment to network
---------------------

This feature allows users to deploy the current project as a dapp in the
main blockchain. This will deploy contracts and register frontend
resources.

The deployment process includes three steps:

-  **Deploy contract**: This step will deploy contracts in the main
   blockchain.

-  **Package dapp**: This step is used to package and upload frontend
   resources.

-  **Register**: To render the dapp, the Ethereum browser (Mist or
   AlethZero) needs to access this package. This step will register the
   URL where the resources are stored.

To Deploy your dapp, Please follow these instructions:

Click on ``Deploy``, ``Deploy to Network``. This modal dialog displays
three parts (see above):

-  **Deploy contract**

-  *Select Scenario*

"Ethereum node URL" is the location where a node is running, there must
be a node running in order to initiate deployment.

"Pick Scenario to deploy" is a mandatory step. Mix will execute
transactions that are in the selected scenario (all transactions except
transactions that are not related to contract creation or contract
call). Mix will display all the transactions in the panel below with all
associated input parameters.

"Gas Used": depending on the selected scenario, Mix will display the
total gas used.

-  *Deploy Scenario*

"Deployment account" allow selecting the account that Mix will use to
execute transactions.

"Gas Price" shows the default gas price of the network. You can also
specify a different value.

"Deployment cost": depending on the value of the gas price that you want
to use and the selected scenario. this will display the amount ether
that the deployment need.

"Deployed Contract": before any deployment this part is empty. This will
be filled once the deployment is finished by all contract addresses that
have been created.

"Verifications". This will shows the number of verifications (number of
blocks generated on top of the last block which contains the last
deployed transactions). Mix keep track of all the transactions. If one
is missing (unvalidated) it will be displayed in this panel.

-  **Package dapp**

-  *Generate local package*

The action "Generate Package" will create the package.dapp in the
specified folder

"Local package Url" the content of this field can be pasted directly in
AlethZero in order to use the dapp before uploading it.

-  *Upload and share package*

This step has to be done outside of Mix. package.dapp file has to be
hosted by a server in order to be available by all users.

"Copy Base64" will copy the base64 value of the package to the
clipboard.

"Host in pastebin.com" will open pastebin.com in a browser (you can then
host your package as base64).

-  **Package dapp**

"Root Registrar address" is the account address of the root registrar
contract

"Http URL" is the url where resources are hosted (pastebin.com or
similar)

"Ethereum URL" is the url that users will use in AlethZero or Mist to
access your dapp.

"Formatted Ethereum URL" is the url that users will use in AlethZero or
Mist to access your dapp.

"Gas Price" shows the default gas price of the network. You can also
specify a different value.

"Registration Cost" will display the amount of ether you need to
register your dapp url.
