This documentation is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort by
volunteers from the Ethereum :ref:`community`.  Although it has not been
authorized by the :ref:`foundation`, we hope you will find it useful.
We welcome new :ref:`contributors`. Note that sections of this guide
may be outdated. The Guide may be considered to be a historic reference
since Ethereum had the Metropolis phase 1 fork, `Constantinople <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-609>`_.
An alternative documentation base may be used at https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki
("the Wiki"), which is being actively maintained, and is also freely
editable by anyone with a GitHub account (while editing this repo requires
making a PR and being merged by a collaborator, or accepting an invitation
as a collaborator). Note that documentation in this guide that is still
relevant could be moved to the Wiki.
