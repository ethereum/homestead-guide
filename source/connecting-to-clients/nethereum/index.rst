**Nethereum**

Nethereum is the .Net integration library for Ethereum, it allows you to interact with Ethereum clients like :ref:`go-ethereum`, :ref:`cpp-ethereum` or :ref:`Parity` using RPC.

The library has very similar functionality as the Javascript Etherum Web3 RPC Client Library.

All the JSON RPC/IPC methods are implemented as they appear in new versions of the clients.

The geth client is the one that is closely supported and tested, including its management extensions for admin, personal, debugging, miner.

Interaction with contracts has been simplified for deployment, function calling, transaction and event filtering and decoding of topics.

The library has been tested in all the platforms .Net Core, Mono, Linux, iOS, Android, Raspberry PI, Xbox and of course Windows.
