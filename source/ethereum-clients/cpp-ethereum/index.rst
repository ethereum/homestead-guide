Quick Start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The Github project for the Ethereum C++ client is `webthree-umbrella <http://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella>`_.
- Please log any issues using the `webthree-umbrella Github issue tracker <http://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues>`_.
- You can chat with the development team and community on the `cpp-ethereum gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum>`_.
- If you just want to install binaries then head to :ref:`Installing binaries`.
- If you want to build from source then head to :ref:`Building from source`.


History of the code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `C++ Ethereum project <http://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella>`_ was
initiated by `Gavin Wood <http://gavwood.com/>`_, the
`former CTO <https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/11/last-blog-post/>`_ of the
Ethereum Foundation, in December 2013.   It is the second most popular of the
clients with around `8% of 'market share' <http://ethernodes.org/>`_, trailing
a long way behind go-ethereum.

Many of the original C++ developers moved on to roles at
`Slock.it <http://slock.it>`_ and `Ethcore <http://ethcore.io>`_ in
late 2015 and early 2016 following a
`75% cut in funding <https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/07/2394/>`_ for C++
development.  Those cuts were part of a broader effort to bring Foundation
costs under control, and they happened prior to the recent spike in ETH
value which has put the Foundation in a much more comfortable financial
position.


What are the primary executables?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **eth** A command-line Ethereum full-node that can be controlled via RPC.
- **mix** An IDE for contract and user interface development, testing and deployment to the blockchain.
- **solc**  The solidity command line compiler
- **lllc** The LLL command-line compiler.


Deprecated executables, to be retired soon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **AlethZero** A Qt-based all-encompassing GUI for interacting with Ethereum (receives minimal support).
- **AlethOne** One-click GUI miner.


Project reboot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project is going through a `reboot under new leadership
<https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/12/ethereum-dev-update-c-roadmap/>`_.  At
the time of writing, we have a number of moving parts.  Please bear with us!

We have been `simplifying the naming
<https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/250>`_, but that is
a work-in-progress.  That will be followed up in our next milestone with
a `consolidation of git
repos <https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/251>`_.


Current reality (squares are applications, circles are libraries):
