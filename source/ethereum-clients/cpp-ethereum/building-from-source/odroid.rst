Building for Odroid XU3/XU4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`EthEmbedded <http://EthEmbedded.com>`_
maintain build scripts for both of these Odroid models.  Support
for a broader range of Odroid devices is likely in the future.
They are on Github in the 
`OdroidXU3-Eth-Install <https://github.com/EthEmbedded/OdroidXU3-Eth-Install>`_ repository.
It is also possible to cross-build for these platforms.
