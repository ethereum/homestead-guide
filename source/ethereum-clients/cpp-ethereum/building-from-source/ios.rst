Building for iOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't currently have a working iOS build, though that is
`on the roadmap <https://github.com/doublethinkco/webthree-umbrella-cross/issues/36>`_
for `doublethinkco <http://doublethink.co>`_.  iOS is a UNIX-like operating
system based on Darwin (BSD) using ARM chips.  This is a
`different API <http://doublethink.co/2015/12/31/a-tale-of-two-abis/>`_
than the ARM Linux cross-builds, meaning that specific binaries will be required.
