We blog about the codebase periodically on the
`Official Ethereum blog <https://blog.ethereum.org>`_ and elsewhere.  Here are
some recent articles from the development team:

* `Ethereum DEV Update: C++ Roadmap <https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/12/ethereum-dev-update-c-roadmap/>`_ (February 2016)
* `C++ DEV Update: Announcing Remix <https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/04/c-dev-update-announcing-remix/>`_ (May 2016)
* `C++ DEV Update â€“ July edition <https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/08/c-dev-update-summer-edition/>`_ (July 2016)
* `Ethereum Everywhere <https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/ethereum-everywhere/>`_ (July 2016)
* `C++ re-licensing plan <https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/c-re-licensing-plan/>`_ (July 2016)

We `simplified the project naming
<https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/250>`_ at Homestead
(March 2016), although some naming shadows of the past still linger.  With the
homecoming we have another name to retire - **webthree-umbrella**.

At the time of writing (August 2016), we are just completing our "Homecoming",
where the code has been reconsolidated into the
`ethereum/cpp-ethereum <https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum>`_
repository.   From October 2015 until August 2016
it was split across multiple repositories under
`ethereum/webthree-umbrella <https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella>`_

The re-licensing plan is the culmination of a very long-term plan to
`liberalize the core <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Licensing>`_.  An
effort was begun in 2015 to re-license the cpp-ethereum core as MIT, but it was
never completed.

This is a revival of that effort, especially with a view
towards the potential for collaboration with the
`Linux Foundation <http://linuxfoundation.org>`_'s
`Hyperledger <https://www.hyperledger.org>`_ project, and with other corporations
outside of Hyperledger who wish to build Ethereum private/consortium chain
solutions similar to `HydraChain <https://github.com/HydraChain/hydrachain>`_.
The `Rubix by Deloitte <http://rubixbydeloitte.com/>`_ project is an example
of that approach.
