What is ether?
================================================================================

Ether is the name of the currency used within Ethereum. It is used to pay for
computation within the EVM. This is done indirectly by purchasing gas for ether as explained in _`gas`.

Denominations
--------------------------------------------------------

Ethereum has a metric system of denominations used as units of Ether. Each denomination has its own unique name (some bear the family name of seminal figures playing a role in evolution of computer science and cryptoeconomics). The smallest denomination aka *base unit* of Ether is called Wei. Below is a list of the named denominations and
their value in Wei. Following a common (although somewhat ambiguous) pattern, Ether also designates a unit (of 1e18 or one quintillion Wei) of the currency. Note that the currency is not called Ethereum as many mistakenly think, nor is Ethereum a unit.


+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| Unit                    | Wei Value | Wei                                       |
+=========================+===========+===========================================+
| **wei**                 | 1 wei     | 1                                         |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Kwei (babbage)**      | 1e3 wei   | 1,000                                     |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Mwei (lovelace)**     | 1e6 wei   | 1,000,000                                 |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **Gwei (shannon)**      | 1e9 wei   | 1,000,000,000                             |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **microether (szabo)**  | 1e12 wei  | 1,000,000,000,000                         |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **milliether (finney)** | 1e15 wei  | 1,000,000,000,000,000                     |
+-------------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------+
| **ether**               | 1e18 wei  | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000                 |

Getting and storing ether
================================================================================

In order to obtain Ether, you need to either

* become an Ethereum miner (see _`Mining`)  or
* trade other currencies for Ether using centralised or trustless services
* use the user friendly `Mist Ethereum GUI Wallet <https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases>`_ that as of Beta 6 introduced the ability to purchase ether using the `Shapeshift`_ API.

Trustless services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the ethereum platform is special in that the smart contracts enable trustless services that obviate the need for trusted third parties in a currency exchange transaction, ie. disintermediate currency exchange businesses.

Such projects (alpha/prelaunch status at the time of writing) are:

* `BTCrelay <http://btcrelay.org/>`_ - `More information <https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/taking-stock-bitcoin-and-ethereum-4382f0a2f17>`_ (about ETH/BTC 2-way peg without modifying bitcoin code).
* `EtherEx decentralised exchange <https://etherex.org>`_.

Sending ether
================================================================================

The `Ethereum Wallet  <https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases>`_  supports sending ether via a graphical interface.

Ether can also be transfered using the **geth console**.

.. code-block:: console

    > var sender = eth.accounts[0];
    > var receiver = eth.accounts[1];
    > var amount = web3.toWei(0.01, "ether")
    > eth.sendTransaction({from:sender, to:receiver, value: amount})

For more information of Ether transfer transactions, see :ref:`account-types-gas-and-transactions`.

Ethereum is unique in the realm of cryptocurrencies in that ether has utility value as a cryptofuel, commonly referred to as "gas". Beyond transaction fees, gas is a central part of every network request and requires the sender to pay for the computing resources consumed. The gas cost is dynamically calculated, based on the volume and complexity of the request and multiplied by the current gas price. Its value as a cryptofuel has the effect of increasing the stability and long-term  demand for ether and Ethereum as a whole. For more information, see :ref:`account-types-gas-and-transactions`.
