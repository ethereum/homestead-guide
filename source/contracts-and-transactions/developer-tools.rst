********************************************************************************
Dapps
********************************************************************************

A dapp is a service that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage). Ethereum dapps typically interface with users via an HTML/Javascript web application using a Javascript API to communicate with the blockchain. Dapps would typically have their own suite of associated contracts on the blockchain which they use to encode business logic and allow persistent storage of their consensus-critical state. Remember that because of the redundant nature of computation on the Ethereum network, the gas costs of execution will always be higher than private execution offchain. This incentivizes dapp developers to restrict the amount of code they execute and amount of data they store on the blockchain.

Dapp directories
====================================

Dapps that use Ethereum are compiled to the following lists. They are listed in various stages of development (concept, working prototype, live/deployed). If you are developing a dapp, consider adding an entry to these listings:

* `Ethercasts State of the Ðapps <http://dapps.ethercasts.com/>`_
* `Dapp Insight <https://dappinsight.com/>`_


The offered decentralised services listed cover a wide range of areas including finance, insurance, prediction markets, social networks, distributed computation and storage, gambling, marketplace, internet of things, governance, collaboration, development and games.

* What apps can we eventually expect? https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/2mnl7f/the_top_10_ether_dapps_of_2015/cm63nsf

In the future, dapps are likely to be listed and distributed in dappstores integrated in dapp browsers.

Dapp browsers
===========================

* `Mist <https://github.com/ethereum/mist>`_ - official GUI dapp browser developed by the foundation, alpha stage. Mist as Wallet dapp is in beta.
* `Status <https://status.im/>`_ - Mobile Ethereum browser (alpha)
* `MetaMask <https://metamask.io/>`_ - Aaron Kumavis Davis's in-browser GUI. `Epicenter Bitcoin interview on github <https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3x97rg/aaron_davis_explains_the_differences_between/>`_ - supported by DEVgrants

Mix is the official Ethereum IDE that allows developers to build and deploy contracts and decentralized applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a Solidity source code debugger.
:ref:`sec:mix` (discontinued)

IDEs/Frameworks

Below are developer frameworks and IDEs used for writing Ethereum dapps.

* `Truffle <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle>`__ - Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum.

Ethereum-console
================================================================================

Command-line console for Ethereum nodes.

`Ethconsole <https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-console>`_ connects to an Ethereum node running in the background (tested with eth and geth) via IPC and provides an interactive javascript console containing the web3 object with admin additions.

You can find a list of available commads here: `ethereum node control commands <https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-console/blob/master/web3Admin.js>`_

To use this console you would need to start a local ethereum node with ipc communication socket enabled (file ``geth.ipc`` in data directory).
By default ipc socket should be located at your local home directory in .ethereum after you started a node.
You could also set ``--test`` option to use specific node test commands.

.. code:: console

   > eth --test
   > ethconsole ipc://path/to/geth.ipc

In the console you could then type

.. code:: console

   > web3.eth.<command name> (arguments, function(){})

Here the defenition of ``--test`` mode node commands:

.. code:: console

   > web3.test.addBlock("[RLP]", function(){}) - Add a block from a string containing its hex RLP
   > web3.test.rewindToBlock:("[int]", function(){}) - Reset the blockchain to specified block number
   > web3.test.mineBlocks:("[int]", function(){}) - Mine a certain amount of NoProof blocks into chain
   > web3.test.modifyTimestamp:("[int]", function(){}) - Set current block timestamp
   > web3.test.setChainParams:("[json]", function(){}) - Reset the blockchain with given node configuration file

Swarm
---------------------------

Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the Ethereum web 3 stack. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as block chain data. From an economic point of view, it allows participants to efficiently pool their storage and bandwidth resources in order to provide the aforementioned services to all participants.

From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from WWW, except that uploads are not to a specific server. The objective is to peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDOS-resistant, zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment. Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution, service payments and content availability insurance.

.. _the-EVM:

The EVM
================================================================================

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only sandboxed, but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem, or other processes. Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.

Contracts live on the blockchain in an Ethereum-specific binary format (EVM bytecode). However, contracts are typically written in an Ethereum high level language, compiled into byte code using an EVM compiler, and finally uploaded on the blockchain using an Ethereum client.
