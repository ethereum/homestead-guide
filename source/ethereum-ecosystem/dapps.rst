Dapps
********************************************************************************
Dapps are programs which are run by many people that either uses or creates a decentralized network for some specific purpose (eg. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, sharing files, online file storage, maintaining a currency). Ethereum-based decentralized applications (also called Đapps, where the Đ is the Norse letter “eth”) typically consist of an HTML/Javascript webpageand a special Javascript API for sending transactions to the blockchain, reading data from the blockchain, and interacting with Whisper and Swarm. A Đapp typically has a specific associated contract on the blockchain, though Đapps that facilitate the creation of many types of contracts are possible.

Dapp directories
====================================

Dapps that use Ethereum are compiled to the following lists. They are listed in various stages of development (concept, working prototype, live/deployed). If you are developing a dapp, consider adding an entry to these listings:

* `Ethercasts State of the Ðapps <http://dapps.ethercasts.com/>`_
* `Dappslist <https://dappslist.com/>`_
* `Dappcentral <http://dappcentral.io/>`_ - Sortable pages for Dapps with instructions, code validation, and network stats.
* `Dapps Mailing List <http://dapplist.net/>`_ - Mailing list for developers on Ethereum (discontinued).

The offered decentralised services listed cover a wide range of areas inlcuding finance, insurance, prediction markets, social networks, distributed computation and storage, gambling, marketplace, internet of things, governance, collaboration, development and games.

In the future, dapps are likely to be listed and distributed in `dappstores_ <http://dappstore.io/>`_ integrated in dapp browsers.
