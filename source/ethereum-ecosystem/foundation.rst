The Ethereum Foundation
***************************************************
The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, and has the purpose of managing the funds that were raised from the Ether Sale in order to best serve the Ethereum and decentralized technology ecosystem.

Founded July 2014 in Switzerland, Stiftung Ethereumâ€™s mission is the promotion of developments of new technologies and applications, especially in the fields of new open and decentralized software architectures.

It is the aim that decentralized and open technologies will be developed, nurtured, promoted and maintained. A dominating, but not exclusive, focus is set on the promotion of the development of the Ethereum Protocol and the relevant technology to it as well as the promotion and support of applications using the Ethereum technology or protocol. Stiftung Ethereum will additionally support and advocate for a decentralized Internet in a variety of forms.
